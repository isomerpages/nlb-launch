While the book’s chapter on transport and communications acknowledges the progress made in Brunei in the road and telecommunications sub-sectors, it recognises that the availability and reliability of public transportation is still unsatisfactory. For example, bus and taxi services are still infrequent and limited. It is vital that the development of the transport and communications infrastructure has been elevated as one of the key thrusts in Brunei’s long-term development plan.

In Chapter 12 of this resource, the transport aims and policies to drive Temburong’s economic growth and its tourism potential are set out. The plan addresses pain points such as poor connectivity by road and water within Temburong as well as from outside the district.

Chapter 2.8 (“Transport and Connectivity”) of this resource discusses the importance of access to services and facilities to facilitate economic growth and social development with the transport network and infrastructure underpinning those activities. The construction of a second national highway could potentially open up the isolated Temburong district and accelerate its development.
