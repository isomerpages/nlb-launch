While the book’s chapter on transport and communications acknowledges the progress made in Brunei in the road and telecommunications sub-sectors, it recognises that the availability and reliability of public transportation is still unsatisfactory. For example, bus and taxi services are still infrequent and limited. It is vital that the development of the transport and communications infrastructure has been elevated as one of the key thrusts in Brunei’s long-term development plan.
