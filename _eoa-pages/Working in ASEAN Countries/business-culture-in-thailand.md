[**The way Thais lead: Face as social capital**](http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=202414732){:target="_blank"}

This book is an insider’s account of Thai leadership based on ethnographic research. It examines the critical importance of ‘face’ in Thai society. The failure to recognise situations where ‘face’ is involved not only leads to awkward relations and misunderstandings, but could also be costly in business interactions.
