[**Television and dating in contemporary China: Identities, love and intimacy**](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=202945157){:target="_blank"}

China's economic and socio-cultural reforms have given rise to a more individualised identity among Chinese youth. This has resulted in changes in attitudes and expectations towards relationships, love and marriage. By analysing popular Chinese TV dating programmes, the author tries to draw a parallel between how the 21st century young Chinese form relationships and the corresponding changes in China's societal structure.
