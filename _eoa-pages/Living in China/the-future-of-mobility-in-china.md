**How China is driving the future of electric cars**

With the goals of becoming a world leader in the electric vehicle (EV) market, cutting greenhouse gas emissions and reducing its reliance on imported oil, the Chinese government provides funding support for companies that produce EVs and incentivises consumers with subsidies for the purchase of EVs. In addition, the government grants EV licenses more liberally as compared to gas or diesel-fuelled vehicles.

[**Why cycling matters for electric mobility: Towards diverse, active and sustainable e-Mobilities**](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17450101.2017.1335463){:target="_blank"}

The paper proposes the concept of e-velomobility, and explores practices, systems and technologies of electrically assisted cycling – in which velomobility’s pedal power combines with e-mobility’s battery/motor assistance to propel the rider. The concept draws on research and policies centred on e-mobility, velomobility and e-bikes. Also presented are studies in China on e-mobility, velomobility and e-bikes.
