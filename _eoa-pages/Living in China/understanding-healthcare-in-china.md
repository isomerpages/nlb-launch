[**China’s dire need to reform health care sector seen as opportunity for private hospitals**](http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2076196/chinas-dire-need-reform-health-care-sector-seen-opportunity){:target="_blank"}

According to analysts, China’s public healthcare system –which has to cope with an increasing number of diseases related to ageing and pollution – is severely in need of reform, and this is where the private hospital sector can come in to help ease the heavy workload of public hospitals. Policies, such as reducing the red tape for setting up private hospitals and allowing these hospitals to determine their own medical fees, could incentivise the setting up of more of such private hospitals.
