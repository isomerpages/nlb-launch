[**SMEs and economic integration in Southeast Asia**](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=203908197)


SMEs account for about 97-99 per cent of total enterprises and 60-80 per cent of total employment in ASEAN countries. SME’s participation is thus crucial for achieving greater regional economic integration amongst ASEAN countries. SMEs are, however, often constrained by many disadvantages that limit their abilities to become importers and exporters. This book examines selected ASEAN country studies on the participation of SMEs in regional economic integration.
