Contributors address a range of issues with a concentrated focus on evidence from Indonesia.

[**The socialist market economy in Asia**](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=205269966)

Three of the best global performers in terms of economic growth are authoritarian states led by communist parties. The ‘socialist market economy’ model employed in China, Vietnam and Laos performs better than the economic systems in countries at a similar level of income per capita on a wide range of development indicators, yet market reforms and governance failures have led to highly unequal societies and significant environmental problems.
