[**Managing Conflicts in a Globalizing ASEAN: Incompatibility management through good governance**](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=204353556)

This book investigates the patterns of conflict management in contemporary Southeast Asia. The region has long been characterized by the twin process of state-formation and nation-building, which has been responsible for the region's conflicts. While this process is still ongoing, regional conflicts and their management are increasingly affected by globalisation, which not only serves as a new source of conflict, but also makes new instruments available for conflict management

[**Uneasy Military Encounters: The imperial politics of counterinsurgency in Southern Thailand**](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=205243550)

The resulting ethnography excavates the imperial politics of concrete encounters between the military and the southern population in the ongoing conflict in southern Thailand.

[**Routledge handbook of contemporary Thailand**](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=204080684)

[**Indonesia: Twenty years of democracy**](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=204402026)

This Element argues that after twenty years of democratization, Indonesia has performed admirably. This is especially so when the country's accomplishments are placed in comparative perspective. However, as we analytically focus more closely to inspect Indonesia's political regime, political economy, and how identity-based mobilizations have emerged, it is clear that Indonesia still has many challenges to overcome, some so pressing that they could potentially erode or reverse many of the democratic gains the country has achieved since its former authoritarian ruler, Soeharto, was forced to resign in 1998.

[**Changing lives in Laos: society, politics, and culture in a post-socialist state**](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=202556738)

During the last two decades, Laos has undergone major transformations due to a massive influx of foreign investment. Improved communications and new forms of mobility have dramatically altered rural life. The book brings together contributions from young scholars that look closely at these transitions and the resulting rise of a new social, cultural, and economic order.

[**Building Inclusive Democracies In ASEAN**](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/Main/browse/resource/1049)

This ebook examines that a well-functioning democracy is part of what ultimately fosters inclusive growth and development. Inequitable access to democratic processes and mechanisms produces government policies and initiatives that are inconsistent with the needs of the majority. It also researches on the symptoms and effects of traditional patron-client politics, experiences, insights, analyses, policy recommendations and on reform efforts along the lines of citizens' participation, transparency, and evidence-based policymaking.
