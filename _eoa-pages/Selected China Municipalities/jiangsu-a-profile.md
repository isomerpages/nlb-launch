Jiangsu province, located on the east coast of China, is bounded by the Yellow Sea to the east, Shanghai municipality to the southeast, and by the provinces of Zhejiang to the south, Anhui to the west, and Shandong to the north. The provincial capital of Nanjing was the southern capital of China during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and the capital under the Nationalist government (1928–49). The city has also been the economic and cultural centre of southern and southeastern China since ancient times. The other major cities of Jiangsu are Suzhou and Wuxi, both located along the Yangtze River.[^6]

Jiangsu’s main industries are electronics, telecommunications, chemicals, machinery and equipment, textiles and garment, and metallurgy. The province is also moving towards the development of new and high technology products and is now an important IT manufacturing base in China.[^9] In 2019, the volume of Jiangsu’s digital economy reached four trillion yuan (around US$600 billion), accounting for over 40 percent of the province's GDP. In the first three quarters of 2020, Jiangsu’s electronic information manufacturing sector's operating income rose over six percent year-on-year to 1.9 trillion yuan. The software and information services sector achieved an operating revenue of 774 billion yuan in 2020, an annual increase of around six percent.[^10]
