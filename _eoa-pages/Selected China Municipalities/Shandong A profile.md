### **Singapore and Shandong**

The Singapore-Shandong Business Council (SSBC) was the first council to be established between Singapore and Shandong. It was the result of a mutual desire to strengthen economic and trade cooperation by both Singapore and Shandong. Singapore-Shandong bilateral economic and trade relations has grown steadily over the years. Total trade between Singapore and Shandong amounted to RMB 7.28 billion in the first half of 2019, with actual investment worth.[^28]

SSBC has identified the trading of food products as one potential growth area. Shandong is the leading agricultural province in China and the top exporter of agricultural produce to Singapore among the Chinese provinces. Key products exported to Singapore include apples, pears and Chinese cabbages. “There is opportunity for Singapore traders and distributors to import a wider range of produce from Shandong that are in demand in Singapore, especially premium fruits and vegetables such as cherries and black garlics. For example, Singapore company Siji Trading is collaborating with NTUC Fairprice to promote Shandong fruits and vegetables in their outlets.” 

 Another area that Singapore companies can also partner Shandong in is the sustainable development, as the province steers its traditional industries such as oil & gas towards more environmentally sustainable practices. These include water and waste management, optimisation of energy utilities and the upgrading efforts of refineries to improve operational efficiency and quality of products. For example, Singapore Vac-Tech Engineering is partnering Yantai’s oilfield services company, Jereh Group, to customise an advanced tank cleaning solution to achieve greater efficiency. The solution is currently undergoing test-bedding on Singapore’s Jurong Island, and will potentially be deployed in Shandong and other markets.[^29]
