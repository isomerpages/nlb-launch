It is surrounded by Hubei and Hunan to the east, Guizhou to the south, Sichuan to the west and north, and Shaanxi at its northeast corner. It was established as one of the four direct-controlled municipalities in 1997 and the only one in west China.

Chongqing is one of the fastest growing cities in China.[^8] Besides the construction of the Three Gorges Dam Project, its rapid economic growth could also be attributed to China’s “favourable policies”, particularly the “Go West” strategy launched in 2000, which aims to generate investment in western China. Chongqing has largely benefitted from the policy and became a significant trading and manufacturing hub as well as a major gateway to west China.[^9] With its strategic location, Chongqing is also “a key strategic node” of the Belt and Road Initiative, which was unveiled in 2013 and aims to connect 65 countries across three continents through China.[^10]



### **Industry**

Chongqing is one of China’s oldest industrial bases, and its major industries include automobiles, iron and steel and aluminium. Heavy industry is the backbone of Chongqing, accounting for 79.6 percent of its gross industrial output in 2018.[^11] However, Chongqing is moving towards the manufacturing of electronic and high technology products. In December 2000, its municipal government established the Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ), a modern industrial base aimed at developing high-tech industries. The zone comprises several zones including the Chongqing Economic and Technological Development Zone, Chongqing High‑Tech Industrial Development Zone and Chongqing Export Processing Zone. Amongst the leading computer and related products manufacturers that have established plants in Chongqing are Foxconn and Inventec from Taiwan.[^12]

Other major export markets include Germany (11.4 percent), South Korea (5.2 percent) and Hong Kong (4.2 percent). Major import sources were South Korea (accounted for 17.1 percent of total imports), Taiwan (11.6 percent) and Malaysia (7.9 percent).[^14]

Over the years, many multinational companies from the electronic industries have established their presence in Chongqing. By the end of 2019, 293 of the world’s top 500 companies have set up operations there.[^15] With the Belt and Road Initiative, Chongqing is expected to seek more foreign investment and trade opportunities.

Its per capita disposal income of urban households in 2018 was RMB34,889, an increase of 8.4 percent from 2017.[^16]Its total retail sales of consumer goods reached RMB1,163.17 billion in 2019, up 8.7 percent from the RMB1,070.52 billion achieved the previous year.[^17]Some of the major local and overseas retailers that have established their presence in Chongqing include Gome from Beijing, Carrefour from France, Walmart from the United States and Metro from Germany.[^18]

### **Singapore and Chongqing**

Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI) is a Singapore-China government-led project launched in 2015. The CCI is aimed at supporting China’s key development strategies and enhancing connectivity in the areas of finance, aviation, transport and logistics and info-communication technology.[^20]

In August 2017, Singapore and Chongqing signed agreements for two joint ventures: the Chongqing Logistics Development Platform (CLDP) and the Multi-Modal Distribution and Connectivity (DC) Centre. These ventures aim to help “develop Chongqing into an inland international logistics hub and contribute to the development of the CCI Southern Transport Corridor”, which in turn aims to enhance connectivity between west China and Southeast Asia.[^21]
