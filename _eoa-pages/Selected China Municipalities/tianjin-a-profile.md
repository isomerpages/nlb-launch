### **Introduction**

Tianjin is a metropolis in the northeastern coast of mainland China. It is one of the four autonomous municipalities in the country, along with Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, that are under the direct administration of the central government. It is northern China’s most important manufacturing centre and leading port.[^5]



### **Economy**

Tianjin reached its 12th Five-Year Plan (2011–15) goals, with an overall GDP of RMB 1.65 trillion. Its GDP increased 12.4 percent annually during this period by supporting scientific innovation and improving the competitiveness of its industries. It also achieved growth by transforming its economic structure and developing its service industry to account for 52 percent of its economy, overtaking manufacturing. The private sector in Tianjin accounted for 46.7 percent of Tianjin’s GDP, as it opened up more to the outside world, attracting 1.55 billion RMB in domestic investment and US$85 trillion in foreign investment. In 2015, there were 162 of the Global Top 500 companies and 216 of China’s Top 500 investing there.[^6]

Tianjin expects its GDP growth to reach 6.5 percent in 2021 compared to 1.5 percent in 2020. The strong momentum in its manufacturing sector has helped propel GDP growth in Tianjin. In 2020, despite the impact from COVID-19, the city's manufacturing sector is reported to have grown for seven straight months. During the period, the sector contributed 72.9 percent of industrial output among all local enterprises each with industrial output above 20 million yuan (US$3.9 million). In particular, its equipment manufacturing and high-tech manufacturing sectors surged by 7.8 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively, 6.2 percent and three percent higher than the city's average. The city has assigned the manufacturing sector as its economic pillar during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-25), becoming the only area among the country's municipalities and provinces to designate the sector as a chief economic pillar.[^7]


### **Binhai New Area**

With the aim of strengthening Tianjin’s position as the economic centre of the Bohai Bay region, priority has been given to the development of the Binhai New Area. Preferential policies have been enacted by the State Council to support the development of the Binhai New Area. In recent years, Tianjin has played a key role in the coordinated development of the Beijing Tianjin Hebei region in relocating non essential functions from Beijing and assisting in the construction of the Xiongan New Area.[^8]

### **Tianjin Free Trade Zone**

The China (Tianjin) Pilot Free Trade Zone (TJFTZ) was officially launched in April 2015 as part of China's second batch of free trade zones following the establishment of the Shanghai FTZ. Its strategic positioning is intended to make it an open platform for the collaborative development of the Beijing Tianjin Hebei region. TJFTZ will fully leverage Tianjin port’s advantages in being able to serve overseas markets, including Northeast Asia, in order to promote economic growth in Beijing, Hebei and other inland regions. [^9]
