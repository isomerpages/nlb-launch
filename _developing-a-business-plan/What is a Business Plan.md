description: "A business plan is a document that explains a businessâ€™
  objectives, the market it is in and how it intends to achieve its goals. It is
  a roadmap that details each stage of the business. A good plan will lay out
  the resources required and forecast financial results over a reasonable
  period. It will also describe the unique qualifications of the founder and
  management team. These plans can help businesses secure funding or attract new
  business partners. "
