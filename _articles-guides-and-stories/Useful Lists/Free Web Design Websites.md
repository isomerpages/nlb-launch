# **Free Web Design Websites**

## **Introduction**

One of the most crucial parts of any business is its website. Allowing your customers to navigate through your website with ease and purpose will reflect on your business positively, while an aesthetic looking site will only draw in more people. When building a website, you should take note of the following: design, domain, hosting, and e-commerce. With an abundance of free website builders available, discover our top picks for you to set up your online presence with little cost and effort.

This is a compilation of some resources on web design websites available from the Internet and is not meant to be an exhaustive list.

## **List of resources**

### 1. **Wix**

Wix is one of the easiest web builders available, perfect for beginners with no experience in web design. Wix offers many template choices and designs, with even more available at extra cost. A free Wix website will display a Wix banner advertisement, and “Wix” will be included in the domain name. Both features can be removed with a paid plan, and e-commerce transactions can only be made via a paid plan.


### 2. **Weebly**

Weebly offers a free plan that is just enough for small businesses starting out. Its website builder is user-friendly, especially if you don’t feel particularly comfortable with designing one from scratch, and Weebly offers a free Weebly domain with free website hosting. E-commerce transactions are possible with a free plan, but you may need to pay transaction fees for this feature.


### 3. **Mailchimp**

Build a website for free inclusive of an email marketing tool with marketing platform Mailchimp. You will be offered a free Mailchimp domain with free website hosting, and you can sell your products and services without cost through payment platform Stripe.


### 4. **GoDaddy**

If you’re looking to build a basic website quickly, GoDaddy can produce one for you after you have answered just three questions. If you want a more personal touch, the website can be further customised, and you can also optimise your site for mobile viewing. A free GoDaddy site will display a bottom banner advertisement, and “GoDaddy” will be included in the domain name. Both features can be removed with a paid plan.

### 5. **WordPress**

With dozens of free themes to choose from and basic customisation options, WordPress has long been a top choice for creating free websites. Although a free WordPress site will also display advertisements and display a branded domain, e-commerce transactions are possible with the free plan through a plugin.
